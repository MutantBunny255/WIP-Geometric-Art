Geometric-Art
A fun personal project I made. It lets you draw polygons onto layers and make them undergo linear matrix transformations.
I used the vector transformation funtions to make a cool moving geometric art.
You can make new shapes and add them to a layer, rotate shapes, and place shapes in a circular pattern.
You can make the layer that shapes are on spin, and grow and shrink.
